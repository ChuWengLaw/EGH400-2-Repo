# EGH400-2-Repo
Evaluation of Parallel Clustering Algorithms for Big Data Analysis

This repository contains 3 MATLAB files for self-implemented k-means algorithm and 1 c++ file for entropy purity test.

To run the files, simply open the km_demo.m script in MATLAB and run it.

Compile EntropyTest.cpp with GNU g++ by using the command:
g++ -o entropy EntropyTest-g++.cpp -lm

Then run it:
./entropy
